# SwissCalculator

### A swiss  calculator that can give you some features:

* plus
* minus
* multiply
* divide
* dark mode
* show device info

## Important
* Maybe you would not need the app to calculate, but you can use it to show your iOS Version for YouTube videos.

* I will publish the source code too, if you want to learn something from me.

* The app is written in Objective-C

* You can take any codes from the app, I will not be angry.

* But don't share my app without putting my name.

* You can report any bugs if you find and you can give a feature request too.
